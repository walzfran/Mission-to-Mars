# Mission-to-Mars

### Module 10 Challenge

#### When working on this challenge I was able to get bot deliverables done. The first one was a bit challenging to figure out exactly how to use the for loop to have the browser get all 4 image urls. Once that was done I was able to move onto deliverable 2, in this deliverable I initially struggled because I broke doen the scraping and the uploading of information into two seperate definitions. With that strategy I was getting the webpage to run with app.py but I was not getting the images to populate, I was able to see that it was because I was populating the URL with two https: which was throwing an error. I was then able to consolidate the two definitions into one which solved the problem of the double https. When working on deliverable 3, I was able to get the webpage to keep formatting similar on all different platforms by altering my columns from md to xs which stops it from stacking when on smaller devices. I was also able to format the images as thumbnails for the mars hemispheres. I then formatted the scrape button and a few of the background colors to be in a similar color range that the mars hemisphere images are in.
